After a _very_ long flight, Hollie and I landed in Tokyo around 5:30pm.

Going through customs was a breeze, but it did take us some time to find the post office to pick up the Pocket WiFi I rented from eConnect.

The woman who helped us exchange our JR Passes was extremely helpful, but we both felt bad when she asked where our hotel is and we had to take some time to look up the address. She really went above and beyond while assisting us, even going so far as to google our hotel and give step by step directions like which train lines to use and which stations to transfer at.

We took the Narita Express to Tokyo station, and from there it was a couple of short train rides to our hotel in Asakusabashi.

The hotel room was a bit smaller than we thought, and unfortunately only had one small bed.

At this point, I had been awake for ~24 hours. The jetlag was very noticable. By all accounts I should have been exhuasted, but I had a difficult time getting to sleep. All I could hope for was once I _did_ get to sleep, it was high quality sleep.
