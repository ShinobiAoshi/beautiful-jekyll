After an unbearably long flight, Hollie and I landed in Tokyo around 5:30pm.

Going through customs was a breeze, but it took some time to find the post office to pick up the Pocket WiFi I rented from eConnect.

The woman who helped us exchange our JR Passes was extremely helpful. We felt awful when she asked where we were staying, and we had to take time to look up the address. Despite that, she went above and beyond while assisting us. She even went so far as to Google our hotel and give step-by-step directions, such as which trains to take and where we needed to transfer.

We took the Narita Express to Tokyo station. From there, it took two short train rides to arrive at our hotel in Asakusabashi. 

Our hotel room ended up being smaller than expected, with only one twin-sized bed. After all the travel, I struggled to keep my eyes open, but had a difficult time falling asleep. All I could hope for was once I got to sleep, it was high quality sleep.
